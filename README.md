# What2Do: An App For Finding New Experiences

Our project involved creating an application by which the user could input a location and receive local data in return. Examples of data include: restuarants, parks, bars, clubs, museums, and much more. Our app is designed to create new life experiences for the user. 

## App User Story/Working Tree
<br>
AS a traveler in a new city or someone looking for new experiences I want an app to help me find what2do.
<br>
WHEN the user loads the page
<br>
THEN the user is presented with an input
<br>
WHEN the user types a location and event
<br>
THEN specific results are displayed on the page matching the user's specific search criteria (events, restaurants, museums, parks, bars, clubs, etc)

## App Functionality
<br>
Google Places Library and Yelp Fusion APIs were used to grab information related to the user's input. They were also used to obtain detailed information regarding the events or restuarants.

By implementing these APIs the user is able to search abbrievated terms and still obtain relevant information ("korean", "steak", "bbq", "chinese", "Philly", "NYC", "D.C.")

What2Do used JavaScript and jQuery in order to add on click events to the HTML and CSS elements (i.e. the search button) on the app's main webpage.

Materalize CSS aided in giving the app's homepage extra flair.
